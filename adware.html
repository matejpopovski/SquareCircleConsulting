					<h2>Adware and false virus alerts</h2>
					<p>
						Square Circle Consulting has been helping with Mac security issues
						more frequently lately. Here are some thoughts about these issues,
						and steps recommended for safer computing. As always, please backup
						before making any changes.
					</p>
					<h3>Adware</h3>
					<p>
						Adware is software that displays unwanted ads. This software often
						redirects web searches and changes home pages to display ads based
						on search history. In some cases, ads are injected into other pages
						as users browse the web. Apple's article on
						<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203987"
							>popups and adware</a
						>
						provides steps for manually removing some adware. Sources include
						deceptive updaters, such as fake Flash and Safari updates, and
						useful software bundled with adware. Since installers typically have
						full access to the Mac, users should download software directly from
						known, trusted companies.
					</p>

						software directly from known, trusted companies.
					</p>

					<h3>False virus alerts</h3>
					<p>
						Users have also reported seeing false virus alerts pop up while web
						browsing. When users call the number displayed in the warning,
						agents ask for a credit card number and remotely pretend to diagnose
						and clean the Mac via screen sharing. Since screen sharing can allow
						full access to the Mac, users should only allow remote control by
						known, trusted companies.
					</p>

					<p>
						Legitimate anti-virus software presents alerts when downloading
						infected files, but doesn't urge users to call a phone number.
					</p>

					<h3>Prevention</h3>
					<p>
						Square Circle Consulting recommends these steps for safer computing:
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Review <a href="backups.html">backup strategies</a>.</li>
						<li>
							Only install software from known, trusted sources. Avoid opening
							downloads and email attachments from unknown sources.
						</li>
						<li>
							Install security updates as they become available.
							<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">Apple</a>
							,
							<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security.html">Adobe</a>
							, and
							<a
								href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/mt637763.aspx"
								>Microsoft</a
							>
							regularly release security updates, sometimes for issues that
							could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
						</li>
						<li>
							Upgrade as needed to remain supported (after reviewing
							<a href="compatibility.html"
								>hardware and software compatibility</a
							>.) Vendors disclose security issues as updates are released, but
							these vulnerabilities are typically only patched on the current
							and previous versions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Since security is ever changing, it's important to run up-to-date,
							commercial anti-virus software to monitor Macs for the latest
							known threats.
						</li>
					</ol>

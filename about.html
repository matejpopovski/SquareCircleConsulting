						I've relied on Square Circle Consulting for Mac support since 2003.
						I am always impressed with David's knowledge of Mac systems and
						diligence in pursuing solutions with software reps. David's
						integrity is impeccable; it provides the foundation for everything
						he does. I have been very fortunate to have him as a trusted
						resource.<br /><br />- Patricia Hoopes, Marketing VP

						installation and maintenance - is approached with your best
						interests first.

					<p>
						- Prompt response, with urgent problems typically resolved the same

						The result is someone who really knows you, your computers, and your
						business. Someone you can truly trust to look out for you, whether
						you're having a problem or just need ongoing maintenance. It's the
						kind of relationship that lets Square Circle Consulting help you
						solve not only today's issues, but also anticipate what you will
						need in the future.

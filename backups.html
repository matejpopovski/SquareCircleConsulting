					<h3>Backup strategies</h3>
					<p>
						Backups can provide protection against data loss such as accidental
						deletion, hardware and software failure, errors, viruses, theft and
						disasters. But backups can fail too. Consider these strategies:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Keep multiple backups</strong> - Keep multiple backups
							with at least one offsite to protect against loss of both the
							original and the backups.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Automate backups</strong> - Schedule regular backups so
							that current data is available when needed. Consider how many
							hours or days you can afford to lose, and backup at least that
							often.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Keep versioned backups</strong> - Keeping several months'
							backups can allow recovery of files missing or corrupted in the
							most recent copies.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Test restores</strong> - Periodically restore sample files
							to verify that backups are usable.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Make bootable backups</strong> - When startup drives fail,
							systems can be started from bootable backups immediately.
							Non-bootable backups such as Time Machine can take hours to
							restore, and may require a replacement drive to restore to.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Use redundant software</strong> - Using two different
							backup programs can provide additional protection and useful
							restore options. For example, Time Machine makes restoring Apple
							Mail messages and mailboxes easy. And if one backup program fails,
							the other may continue.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Schedule reviews</strong> - Backups stop working for many
							reasons, such as low disk space, name changes, and upgrade
							compatibility issues. Periodic reviews help to ensure that backups
							are available when needed.
						</li>
					</ul>

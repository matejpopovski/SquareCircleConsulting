					<h3>One stop for all of your Macintosh technical needs</h3>
					<p>
						Apple products are designed to be reliable and easy to use. But the
						unexpected does happen and adding products from other companies
						often complicates matters. There are also upgrades, maintenance and
						other ongoing needs to consider.
					</p>
					<p>
						Square Circle Consulting helps you where you're at &mdash; on-site,
						online or over the phone with:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Time-saving expertise</b> - Remove the time- and
							energy-consuming burden of self-solving, instead putting expertise
							to work for fast, accurate solutions.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Objective advice</b> - Square Circle Consulting offers
							recommendations driven by your needs, not by products.
